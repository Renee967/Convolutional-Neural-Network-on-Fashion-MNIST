Abstract

The saved notebook displays the development, training and testing of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify between different items of clothing. The model is trained using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The final train and test accuracy were found to be 97% and 89%, respectively. Additionally, various parameters including the learning rate, activation functions, and dropout layers were modified/added to observe the behaviour of the model.

Dependencies

Please ensure to install the following dependencies before executing the notebook:

PyTorch
Matplotlib

how to run the code in each notebook

step 1- install the packages mentioned in each notebook then run all cells


python version Python 3.9.7

how to run code on a different version from Python 3.9.7:
1. Install Python 3.10.6:
Download Python 3.10.6 from the official Python website: Python Downloads
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following commands:

# On Windows
python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv

3.Activate the Virtual Environment:
On Windows: 
.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Required Packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

5.Run the Code:
With the virtual environment activated, navigate to the directory containing your Python script and run it:
